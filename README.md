# Codsoft Data Science Internship

Welcome to my Codsoft Data Science Internship repository! This repository is dedicated to my internship tasks, and I'll be sharing my progress and findings here.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Task Description
In this task, I'll be working on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a dataset that includes various features like age, gender, class, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

### Approach
To complete this task, I will follow these steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: I will start by exploring the Titanic dataset, examining its structure, and gaining insights into the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: I will clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for model training.

3. **Feature Engineering**: I will create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's performance.

4. **Model Building**: I will select and implement machine learning algorithms, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

5. **Model Deployment**: Once a satisfactory model is developed, I may explore options for deploying it in a real-world scenario.

## Task 2: Iris Flower Classification

### Task Description
In this task, I'll be working on classifying different species of Iris flowers based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It's a classic machine learning problem used for classification.

### Approach
To complete this task, I will follow these steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: I will explore the Iris dataset and understand its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: I will preprocess the data as needed for machine learning.

3. **Model Selection**: I will choose and implement suitable classification algorithms.

4. **Model Evaluation**: I will evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics.

## Task 3: Movie Rating Prediction

### Task Description
In this task, I'll be working on predicting movie ratings based on various features, which could include user reviews, movie genres, and other relevant information. The goal is to build a predictive model for movie ratings.

### Approach
To complete this task, I will follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: I will gather data related to movie ratings, including user reviews and movie attributes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: I will clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.

3. **Model Building**: I will develop machine learning models to predict movie ratings.

4. **Model Evaluation**: I will assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

- [ ] Task 3: Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Task 3: Model Building
- [ ] Task 3: Model Evaluation

## Task 4: Sales Prediction

### Task Description
In this task, I'll be working on predicting sales figures for a given product or set of products. The prediction could be based on historical sales data, marketing strategies, and other relevant factors.

### Approach
To complete this task, I will follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: I will collect historical sales data and any other relevant information.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: I will preprocess the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for modeling.

3. **Model Building**: I will develop machine learning models to predict future sales.

4. **Model Evaluation**: I will evaluate the models' performance and fine-tune them as needed.
